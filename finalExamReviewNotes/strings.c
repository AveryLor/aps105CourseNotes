In C, string literals are stored in read-only memory, and modifying them results in undefined behavior. 
That means your program might crash, might do nothing, or might corrupt memory â€” there's no guarantee.
puts(); -> Prints a string to stdout, followed by a newline.

fgets(st, 3, stdin); -> Puts an additional \0
strlen(st); -> Returns the length of the string excluding the null terminator.
strcpy(st, "Hello"); -> Copies the string "Hello" into st. The destination must be large enough to hold the source string and the null terminator.
strcat(st, "World"); -> Concatenates the string "World" to st. The destination must be large enough to hold the concatenated result. Concatenates to the end of the string
strcmp(st, "Hello"); -> Compares st with "Hello". Returns 0 if they are equal, a negative value if st is less than "Hello", and a positive value if st is greater than "Hello".
strchr searches for a character in a string. It returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character in the string, or NULL if the character is not found.
strstr(s1, s2) searches for a substring in a string. The function returns a pointer ot the first occurence of s2 in s1. If s2 is not found in s1, the function returns NULL.
