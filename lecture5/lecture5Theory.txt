Learning about the math library in this lecture

The rint() functions return the integral value (represented in a floating-point mode) nearest x using the round to nearest mode

Randomness is determined by the seed value, therefore if you run the program again it will return the same numbers 
It generates a deterministic sequence of numbers based on a seed value.
