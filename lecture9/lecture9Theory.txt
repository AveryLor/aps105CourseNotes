Today's focus: for loops

It runs a loop a finite number of times based on a counter variable. 

You have three expressions, one of setting the variable, the comparison method and then finally the manual counter. 


You can use continue to continue through the code, everything after that statement is going to be ignored, break, breaks out of the loop

Continue completes skips the rest of the code after being read
